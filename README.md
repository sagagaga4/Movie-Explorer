## 🌟 Overview  
Movies Explorer is a fullstack web application that allows users to browse, search, and filter movies with a modern, smooth user experience.  
The frontend is built **entirely with Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks!) using **Web Components**, **dynamic client-side routing**, and **View Transitions API**.  
On the backend, a **Go-powered JSON API** handles authentication, logging, and database access with **PostgreSQL** for persistence.  

This project demonstrates how to build robust, high-performance applications with minimal dependencies—making it fast, maintainable, and production-ready.
